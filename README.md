## Description
This is a (very basic) search engine that takes your search and lists the top
ten results from Twitter and Wiki.  It uses each site's API and sends in a 
search query.

## Goals
1. Add testing suite to application.
2. Give option to search only Twitter or Wikipedia.
3. Give Twitter geolocation option.
