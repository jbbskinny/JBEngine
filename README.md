## Description
This is a (very basic) search engine that takes your search and lists the top
ten results from Twitter and Wiki.  It uses each site's API to output the search
results.

## Goals
1. Add more test suites to application. Specifically, find a way to test the
server-side get requests for proper output and error handling.
2. Give option to search only Twitter or Wikipedia.
3. Give Twitter geolocation option.
