## Description
This is a (very basic) search engine that takes your search and lists the top
ten results from Twitter and Wiki.  It uses each site's API and sends in a 
search query.

Be warned, as of now the site is not fully operational because of Twitter's
API authentication requirements.

## Goals
1. Add testing suite to application.
2. Figure out why BoyCook's code is not working for me (Twitter API v1.1 is rude).
3. Have a results only page.
4. Give option to search only Twitter or Wikipedia.
5. Give Twitter geolocation option.
