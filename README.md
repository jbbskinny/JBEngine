%% Description
This is a (very basic) search engine that takes your search and lists the top
ten results from Twitter and Wiki.  It uses each site's API and sends in a 
search query.

Be warned, as of now the site is not fully operational because of Twitter's
API authentication requirements.  I must first deploy it on a web server using
HTTPS protocol and continue the debug process.  See last commit for the
Twitter API (with Lebron James search hardcoded).

%% Goals
1. Deploy on server.
2. Have a results only page.
3. Give option to search only Twitter or Wikipedia.
4. Give Twitter geolocation option.
5. (next step) Make test package using mocha.

Will provide the link when it is operational.
